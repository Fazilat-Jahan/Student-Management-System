# IT HUB SMS - Student Management System


## Overview
Welcome to the IT HUB Student Management System (SMS). This command-line application allows you to manage student enrollments, course selections, tuition fee payments, and view student statuses and balances. Built using TypeScript, the system leverages Inquirer for interactive prompts and Chalk for styled console output, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing students.


## In-Memory Data Storage
The application maintains an in-memory database to store student information during the session. This approach ensures quick access and modification of data. The data is retained throughout the session and is lost once the application is exited.
